## Core Features:

- Mandatory Authentication: Enforce secure user authentication via college email (@reva.edu.in) to access app features and data. Implemented using JWT for persistent sessions.
- Dual-Role System: Allow users to toggle between 'Regular User' and 'Club Member' roles. Role changes require server confirmation.
- Platform-Optimized Home Screen: Implement a tabbed interface optimized for Android (Material Design 3) and iOS (Cupertino design), featuring sections for Cultural Events, Hackathons, Clubs, and Tech Events.
- Event Display with Color-Coded Status: Display events using platform-specific cards (Material Cards for Android, Holographic Cards for iOS). Color-code event status (available, almost full, full, on-spot registration) with animated effects.
- Coupon Economy System: Implement a coupon-based reward system with animated coupon counters, secure transactions, and login-protected access. Show a confetti effect as soon as a new user registers to show that they have won 50 coupons for free, and also display that 2 coupons = 1rupee, and with that also specify " to win coins win in events "
- Animated UI Magic: Animate the user interface (UI) in response to a tool. It uses mouse/finger movement for magic touch-like interactions (sparkle effect where the screen is touched), offering haptic feedback.
